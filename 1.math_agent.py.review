# Code Review Suggestions for 1.math_agent.py

1. **Error Handling for Division**:
   - The `divide` function should include error handling to manage division by zero. This is important to prevent runtime errors when the second argument is zero.
   
   ```python
   if b == 0:
       raise ValueError("Cannot divide by zero.")
   ```

2. **Type Annotations and Input Validation**:
   - Although function parameters are annotated with types, there should also be some validation to ensure inputs are integers and to enforce type safety. You can consider adding `isinstance()` checks.
   
   ```python
   if not isinstance(a, int) or not isinstance(b, int):
       raise TypeError("Both arguments must be integers.")
   ```

3. **Documentation**:
   - While the functions have docstrings, consider expanding these to include return types and more descriptive examples of how the functions could be used.

4. **Code Consistency**:
   - The `divide` function's return type is `float`, while `multiply` and `add` return `int`. It's a good practice to maintain consistency in return types if the operations deal with similar data (in this case, integer math). You might want to consider returning `float` types for `multiply` and `add` as well if that is your design intention.

5. **Magic Numbers in Comments**:
   - The comment in `human_message` regarding the cities is not used and might create confusion. It would be better to either remove commented-out code or add context explaining why it is commented out.

6. **Testing**:
   - Include unit tests for each of the functions to ensure they work as expected. This could help catch any edge cases, such as negative values and very large numbers.

7. **Code Formatting**:
   - Ensure that the code adheres to PEP 8 style guidelines. Consider using tools like Black or Flake8 to automatically format your code and check for style issues.

8. **Imports Organization**:
   - Group and order your imports. Standard practice is to place standard library imports first, followed by third-party imports, and then local application/library imports.
